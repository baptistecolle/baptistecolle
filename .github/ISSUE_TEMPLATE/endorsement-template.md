# How to Endorse a Skill ✨ 

## Option 1: Create a New Endorsement
1. Edit the title above to replace `<SKILL_HERE>` with the skill you want to endorse
2. Edit the title to replace `<EMOJI>` with an emoji that represents the skill

Example titles:
- `Endorse: 🐍 Python`
- `Endorse: 🧠 Machine Learning`
- `Endorse: 🎨 UI/UX Design`

PS: why add an emoji? because who doesn't love emojis? 🤩

## Option 2: Endorse an Existing Skill
If someone has already endorsed a skill:
- [Browse existing endorsements](https://github.com/baptistecolle/baptistecolle/issues)
- Add a reaction (for example 👍, 💪, 🔥, etc.) or comment on that issue to endorse the skill 
    - (This is done automatically by a Github Action)
